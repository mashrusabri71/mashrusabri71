# 👋 Hello, World! I'm Mashrur Rashid

## 🎭 Code by Day, Act by Night

I'm not your average developer - I'm a code-slinging, scene-stealing, bug-squashing maestro with a flair for the dramatic! When I'm not crafting elegant algorithms, you might find me on stage or in front of a camera, bringing characters to life as a proud member of ACTRA.

## 🚀 My Tech Journey

- 🎮 **Game Dev Guru**: Most of my work has been in game development, where I've breathed life into pixels and polygons.
- ☁️ **Cloud Climber**: Currently ascending the peaks of cloud computing, because why keep my code earthbound?
- 🕵️ **QA Quester**: On a mission to become the Sherlock Holmes of Quality Assurance. No bug is safe from my magnifying glass!

## 🏆 Project Showcase

- 🕹️ **3D Pacman Shooter**: Who said Pacman can't pack heat? Unity-powered nostalgia with a twist!
- 🧠 **Madtrix**: A C++ puzzle game so addictive, it should come with a warning label.
- 🎨 **Video Color Calibrator**: Because life's too short for badly calibrated videos!
- ♟️ **Four the Board Game**: Java-powered fun that'll have you shouting "Checkmate!" (Wrong game, but you get the idea)

## 🎭 When I'm Not Coding...

You might catch me:
- 🎬 Acting in a local production
- 🧊 Solving Rubik's cubes at lightning speed
- 🎮 Playtesting games (for research, of course!)
- 🍕 Debating whether pineapple belongs on pizza (it does, fight me)
